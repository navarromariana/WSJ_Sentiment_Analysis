Web scrapped Wall Street Journal titles to conduct a sentiment analysis to look at how the finite pool of attention evolves over time regarding the coverage of the Palestine/Israel war and Ukraine/Russia war.

In today’s fast-paced interconnected world, information is at our fingertips. Thereby, it’s crucial to
understand how conflicts capture attention. This work aims to explore the dynamics of attention
allocation and explain how it changes over time in the context of two complex and multifaceted
conflicts: the Palestine/Israel war and the Ukraine/Russia war. The finite pool of attention refers
to the limited capacity individuals and societies have to focus on and engage with various issues
and events. As these conflicts evolve, the allocation of attention towards them can fluctuate and
change over time. The process of the finite pool of attention’s evolution regarding the coverage
of the Palestine/Israel war and the Ukraine/Russia war is complex and dynamic. Understanding
how attention is distributed and evolves over time concerning these conflicts is critical to understanding their global impact and the narratives that shape public perception.
